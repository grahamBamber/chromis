For config data and sessions we are using "redis". Instructions for Windows are in 
windows_reade.txt.

For other tables we are using Postgres (on Windows we are also using pgAdminIII for admin stuff).
With this tool you can create users (login roles) so for RNS we created 
a user of "chromis" with a password of "Hercule2".  These are used as defaults in the 
connections config.
